React project for PTEC 

These are the files that I used to create the react project for PTEC.

Currently the website isn't hosted anywhere as https://ptecreactproject.web.app/ is used for [CSS-Bonus-Mark-Project-Incorporated-Into-React](https://github.com/Nazarchamp/CSS-Bonus-Mark-Project-Incorporated-Into-React). However, the only difference between the two projects is the CSS techniques used, and they look near identical to each other.
